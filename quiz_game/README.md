# 🎉 My First Python Project – Quiz Game 🎉
**Made with Python 🐍 | Command-line fun 🎮 | Learning step by step**

Hey! 👋
This is my **very first Python project** (with a little help from ChatGPT 🤝).
It’s a simple **command-line quiz game** that pulls questions from the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) API. I made it to practice Python, have fun, and see my code come alive!

## 🛠️ What It Does
- Lets you pick how many questions you want to answer 
- Mix of multiple-choice and true/false questions
- Shows your **score and grading** at the end
- Gives **corrections** for any wrong answers so you can actually learn something

## 🚀 How to Try It

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alae-Mo/quiz_game.git
   cd quiz_game
   ```
2. Install requirements:

3. Run the game:

## 🌟 What’s Next

- Add a **cool UI** (Tkinter or PyQt)
- Let you choose difficulty levels and categories
- Track your score history

## 🙌 Why I Made This

This project is **my first mini Python project** on GitHub.
It’s small, but I’m proud of it! 😄
I’m learning step by step, and this is just the beginning of more projects to come, insha'Allah.
